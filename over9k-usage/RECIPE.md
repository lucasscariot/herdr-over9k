# Over9k Usage

Know your limits before you hit them. Claude's, Codex's and Gemini's 5-hour and
weekly limits sit in one line along the bottom of the window, each coloured green,
yellow or red, with when it resets. Cursor and Grok quotas can be enabled through
[CodexBar](../README.md#cursor-and-grok-quotas). Hover a service to see every limit.

## What you see

- **The strip**, docked at the bottom, 30px high, on `chrome` with a 1px
  `border` above, in 12px. For each service:
  - its name in `muted`
  - its plan in a 10.5px badge (`raised`, `accent` text)
  - the most-used limit's percentage: `ansi2` (green) under 50, `ansi3` (yellow)
    from 50, `ansi1` (red) from 80
  - the time until it resets, in 11px `dim`
- **Claude billed by use** (Amazon Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, an API key) has no
  plan limits, so its row shows a badge saying which, one row per computer, and its cost, such as
  "1d $14.20". Open it for tabs (30d, 2w, 1w, 1d; also the row's number) and
  a bar a day stacked by model, with each model's cost as the key. It's estimated from tokens at list prices, not the AWS bill.
- **Inside the Over9k layout**, the same data is drawn as 28px rows above the
  sidebar's footer. Clicking a row opens every limit as a 3px bar.

## How it behaves

- **Hover:** a service shows every limit and its reset time.
- **"Claude · Show its limits"**, a link in `accent` at the end of the strip,
  shows when Claude Code is installed, Over9k's status line isn't on and
  there's no Claude row. It runs `setup.sh status on <this mod>/claude-statusline.sh`.
  That puts a line under Claude Code's prompt (model, effort, context, cache,
  limits) and saves the limits. Any other status line is kept in
  `~/.claude/.over9k-statusline-was.json` and comes back with
  `setup.sh status off`.
- **Where the data comes from:**
  - **Claude:** `~/.cache/over9k/usage/claude.json`, `{at, five_hour,
    seven_day}`, plus the plan name from `~/.claude.json`. Claude Code only
    hands its limits to a status line, so this file comes from Over9k's
    optional one, `claude-statusline.sh`. Billed by use it holds
    `{at, "api": "Bedrock"}`. The cost comes from `api-cost.py`, run on that
    computer: every transcript's tokens at list prices, once per `requestId`,
    with parsed files cached in `usage/api-cost-cache.json`.
  - **Codex:** its latest session file under `~/.codex/sessions`.
  - **Gemini:** `~/.cache/over9k/usage/antigravity.json`, from Antigravity's
    status line (`agy-statusline.sh` in the Over9k layout: Options › Session footers).
  - **Cursor and Grok:** `codexbar usage --provider <name> --format json`,
    polled every five minutes when named in the `codexbar` array in Herdr's
    `data/over9k-usage.json`. Show measured quota windows with their supplied
    labels and reset times. Display **Unavailable** when there is no current
    reading.

## Built from

- **`mods/over9k-usage/`**, with `mod.json` set to
  `{"place": "bottom", "size": 30}`:
  - `main.js`: the strip, or the layout's rows.
  - `codexbar.js`: parses the optional Cursor and Grok quota readings.
  - `claude-statusline.sh`: the optional status line.
  - `setup.sh`: turns it on or off.
- `main.js` draws rows when the layout has a block with id `usage` holding this
  mod (the Over9k layout), and the strip otherwise. Only the rows resize their
  block (`layout.resize`).
- **herdr:** `layout`, `run`, `exec` (`sh`, `jq`), `readTextFile`, `notify`,
  `shared` (`sidebar.options` hides services in Over9k).
- **Programs:** `sh` and `jq`. Cursor and Grok use the optional `codexbar`
  executable, which makes its own provider requests.

## Watch out

- The strip has no room to open rows, so it lists limits on hover instead.
- Without `usage/claude.json` there's no Claude row. Turn the status line on
  only when the user asks: it replaces theirs while on.

## Done when

- The strip docks at the bottom and shows Codex's limits after a Codex
  session.
- With `usage/claude.json` present, Claude shows with its plan and percentage.
- `~/.claude/settings.json` is untouched.
